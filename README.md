# yhackynot
This is our hackathon project from Yhack 2016. Our project seeks to give those who have faced discrimination a voice they haven't used and support they didn't know they had. Through our platform, users can add their personal account of what and when a discriminatory event occurred. Our platform collects and visualizes this data to address discrimination against minority communities throughout United States to inspire change. Another feature of our platform allows users to see a timelapse when new data is added, and as more data is accumulated, it is our hope that an anaylsis of the density and frequency of such events can be addressed to improve upon the unjust treatment to others that is still very much a problem in the U.S.
